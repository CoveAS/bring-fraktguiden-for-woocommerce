Bring Fraktguiden provides shipping calculations based on shipping rates from bring.no

All standard shipping methods from Bring are built-in. Volume calculations based on product dimensions and weight.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to wp-admin > WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping
4. Select **Bring Fraktguiden**
5. Enable and configure Bring Fraktguiden

#### Setting up Woocommerce

To ensure Bring is working correctly, you must set the following:

1. **Dimension and weight units**
	* WooCommerce > Settings > Products
2. **Currency**
	* WooCommerce > Settings > General
3. **Product dimentions**
	* Woocommerce > Products > Product

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do rates not show up on the cart page?**

A: Rates are only shown when the customer has a valid postcode/zip code.

**Q: My products have dimensions, but they're being classified as heavy, why?**

A: Check your dimensions are set to the right unit values. Often, products are measured in MM but the default woocommerce unit is CM. This causes Bring to consider your products to be 10x their size.
