== Installation ==

When you install Bring, you need to head to the settings page to start configuring Bring to your specifications.

1. Upload `bring-fraktguiden-for-woocommerce` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install through Wordpress
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to Dashboard >WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping
4. Select **Bring Fraktguiden** on the sub menu
5. Configure Bring Fraktguiden with your address and pricing
6. Start shipping!

== Prerequisites ==

To ensure Bring will work correctly, you must set the following:

1. **Dimension and weight units**
    * WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Set your default dimensions

2. **Currency**
    * WooCommerce > Settings > General > Set store currency

3. **Product dimensions**
    * Woocommerce > Products > Select a products > Set the dimensions for the item
        - This will fallback to the options in the Bring Settings if you don't set them here.
